                                This is where we'll describe Alexie and her fascinating life and accomplishments. As the first-born daughter, she carries the mantle of the Harper clan now and into the future. She has traveled the world, from Texas to Boston and a few areas of Europe in between.</p>

                                The Goat Barn is the perfect location for discerning hosts who prefer originality in lieu of hotel banquet rooms. The charm of the Texas Hill Country is truly captured by the barn and its surroundings. What once was truly a working barn for goats in the 1890’s, now has magnificently refinished reclaimed barn wood walls, a state of the art kitchen and two functioning bars. The downstairs area of the Barn consists of vaulted ceilings and beautiful wooden floors that are also made from reclaimed barn wood. In the front of the building stands a 300 year old Oak Tree with a huge canopy for shaded I do's and a perfect view of the setting sun.

                                Gabriele Meissner McCormick and David Lawhorn had lived in various big cities before settling in San Antiono in 1982. Both were working in the corporate environment and found they were looking for peace and quiet and a place to have a small garden while still commuting. Their new found love of the Texas hill country and luck brought them to Welfare. Early in 1992, they purchased the town, which included the historic Beseler homestead, general store &amp; post office, various barns, and 150 acres of the original 160 acres surveyed to Carl Philip Beseler in 1854.

                                In April of 1998, site clean-up and restoration of the Welfare Café began. A conscious decision was made to stabilize and retain the original character of the building. In July of 1998, Gabriele decided she had enough of corporate management, followed her heart and love of cooking, and turned her energies to opening a café. By the end of November that same year, the day after Thanksgiving the Welfare café was open for business. A year later, staying true to Gabriele’s heritage, the bier garten was opened.

                                In 2005, The Goat Barn was built using all the reclaimed wood from the original barn in addition to reclaimed materials David Lawhorn had been taking down from various unwanted buildings in the area. The first wedding and reception was held in April of 2005.

                                Their love of antiquity, nature, delicious food and history are brought together in what is now Welfare, Texas.
