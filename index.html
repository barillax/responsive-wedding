                                Alexie spent the first seven years of her life in Sumter, SC, where her father was stationed as an Air Force officer. She moved with her parents, Michael and Dolores, and sister, Allison, to Fair Oaks Ranch, TX just in time to start 2nd grade. Over the next eleven years, she grew to love the Texas Hill Country, and she still considers herself a Texan at heart. Alexie received her undergraduate degree in English Literature and Language with a minor in Italian from Harvard University, and recently received a Master's Degree from NYU in Irish Studies. She owns a fun-loving, slightly paranoid dog named Caspian who continues to give her reasons for never adopting another dog.</p>

                                Born in Chicago, IL, Ori spent the first seven years of his life in the windy city. After his father took a job as a professor at James Madison University, the family traded the city life for Harrisonburg, VA. Growing up in an artistic household, he has fond memories of many hours spent drawing, painting, and sculpting, often alongside his parents, Peter and Sharon, as they worked on similar projects. In High School, Ori discovered computer programming, and hasn't looked back. After graduating from the University of Virginia with a degree in Computer Science, he worked for Rosetta Stone for ten years, ultimately leaving in 2013 to start a new company, Pedago, with Alexie. </p>

                            <h2>HOW WE MET</h2>
                            <p>
                                In 2005, Ori and Alexie met for the first time at Rosetta Stone while working together on the "Dogwalk" research project. Alexie had heard good things about Ori during the months before he returned to Rosetta Stone to work there full time; as an intern the previous summer, he had impressed his coworkers with his intelligence and hard work. As she got to know him, Alexie was similarly impressed by his work ethic and creativity, but the two worked together only briefly before the "Dogwalk" team transformed into the Version 3 production team, and the former team members no longer worked together on a daily basis.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Ori didn't know what exactly to expect when returned to Rosetta Stone after graduation. He was happily surprised to find himself working with a bright and quirky group of artists, writers, and developers. As Ori got to know the team, Alexie immediately stood out; she was undeniably smart and creative, overflowing with ideas. He loved her habit of writing short poems and prose to share with the team, including a rather intricate retelling of The Neverending Story incorporating much of the office as its characters. These days were not to last, however, and as the project grew the two were soon pushed into new roles and separate teams.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Several years went by. In the interim, Ori moved to Washington, D.C., Alexie got a dog, and they both started new projects. In 2009, Alexie moved to Washington, D.C. to be within closer commuting distance to New York City, where she was attending graduate school. (It wasn't very much closer, but every little bit helped!) Alexie and Ori reconnected as friends, and at some point realized how much they enjoyed each other's company! They've been together ever since, traveling, enjoying life in the D.C. area, and now embarking on a new work adventure together as Co-founders of Pedago.

                            <h2>THE ENGAGEMENT</h2>
                            <p>After close to a decade of Rosetta Stone, Ori and Alexie were both ready for a change. They decided to move on from their jobs in February 2013, and almost immediately set off to New Zealand for a 3-week vacation. Ten days into the trip, the pair had reached Kaikoura, a beautiful seaside village at the base of the Southern Alps famous for its seal colony and year-round dolphin swims. There, they toured the gardens of the Lavendyl Lavender Farm, eventually coming upon the "Circle of Thyme". As Alexie moved forward under the trellis, Ori retrieved the ring he had been secretly carrying in his backpack for the entire trip, dropping to one knee just as Alexie turned around.</p>

                            <h2>ABOUT THE GOAT BARN</h2>    
                            <p>
                                The Goat Barn is the perfect location for discerning hosts who prefer originality in lieu of hotel banquet rooms. The charm of the Texas Hill Country is truly captured by the barn and its surroundings. What once was a working barn for goats in the 1890’s now has magnificently refinished reclaimed barn wood walls, a state-of-the-art kitchen and two functioning bars. The downstairs area of the Barn consists of vaulted ceilings and beautiful wooden floors that are also made from reclaimed barn wood. In front of the building stands a 300 year old Oak Tree with a huge canopy for shaded "I do's" and a perfect view of the setting sun.
