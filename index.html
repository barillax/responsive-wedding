                                <img src="img/alexieThumb.jpg" class="thumb" alt="Alexie" />
                                Alexie was born in Columbia, SC, and spent the next seven years in Sumter, SC, where her father was stationed as an Air Force officer.  She moved with her parents and sister, Allison, to Fair Oaks Ranch, TX just in time to start second grade.  Over the next eleven years, she grew to love the Texas Hill Country, and she still considers herself a Texan at heart. Alexie received her undergraduate degree in English Literature and Language with a minor in Italian from Harvard University, and recently received a Master's Degree from New York University in Irish and Irish-American Studies. After working for Rosetta Stone for 8 years, she left in early 2013 to start Pedago with Ori. </p>

                                <img src="img/oriThumb.jpg" class="thumb" alt="Ori" />
                                Born in Chicago, IL, Ori spent the first seven years of his life in the windy city. After his father took a job as a professor at James Madison University, the family traded the city life for Harrisonburg, VA. Growing up in an artistic household, he has fond memories of many hours spent drawing, painting, and sculpting, often alongside his parents as they worked on similar projects. In High School, Ori discovered computer programming, and hasn't looked back. After graduating from the University of Virginia with a degree in Computer Science, he worked for Rosetta Stone for ten years, ultimately leaving in 2013 to start a new company, Pedago, with Alexie. </p>

                            <h2>THE ENGAGEMENT</h2>
                            <p>After close to a decade of Rosetta Stone, Ori and Alexie were both ready for a change. They decided to quit in February 2014, and almost immediately set off to New Zealand for a 3-week vacation. Ten days into the trip, the pair had reached Kaikoura, a beautiful seaside village at the base of the Southern Alps famous for its seal colony and year-round dolphin swims. There, they toured the gardens of the Lavendyl Lavender Farm, eventually coming upon the "Circle of Thyme". As Alexie moved forward under the trellis, Ori retrieved the ring he had been secretly carrying in his backpack for the entire trip, dropping to one knee just as Alexie turned around.</p>

                                The Goat Barn is the perfect location for discerning hosts who prefer originality in lieu of hotel banquet rooms. The charm of the Texas Hill Country is truly captured by the barn and its surroundings. What once was truly a working barn for goats in the 1890’s, now has magnificently refinished reclaimed barn wood walls, a state of the art kitchen and two functioning bars. The downstairs area of the Barn consists of vaulted ceilings and beautiful wooden floors that are also made from reclaimed barn wood. In the front of the building stands a 300 year old Oak Tree with a huge canopy for shaded I do's and a perfect view of the setting sun.

                            <h2>HISTORY OF WELFARE, TX</h2>
                            <p>
                                Gabriele Meissner McCormick and David Lawhorn had lived in various big cities before settling in San Antiono in 1982. Both were working in the corporate environment and found they were looking for peace and quiet and a place to have a small garden while still commuting. Their new found love of the Texas hill country and luck brought them to Welfare. Early in 1992, they purchased the town, which included the historic Beseler homestead, general store &amp; post office, various barns, and 150 acres of the original 160 acres surveyed to Carl Philip Beseler in 1854.

                                In April of 1998, site clean-up and restoration of the Welfare Café began. A conscious decision was made to stabilize and retain the original character of the building. In July of 1998, Gabriele decided she had enough of corporate management, followed her heart and love of cooking, and turned her energies to opening a café. By the end of November that same year, the day after Thanksgiving the Welfare café was open for business. A year later, staying true to Gabriele’s heritage, the bier garten was opened.

                                In 2005, The Goat Barn was built using all the reclaimed wood from the original barn in addition to reclaimed materials David Lawhorn had been taking down from various unwanted buildings in the area. The first wedding and reception was held in April of 2005.

                                Their love of antiquity, nature, delicious food and history are brought together in what is now Welfare, Texas.
